They document the social, cultural and artistic history of the Chicano and Latino community. <br/>Artist statement courtesy of Oscar Castillo: As a youth my parents influenced me in that my mother kept a family photo album, which I keep now, in which our family photos and memories were kept. These were not just snapshots, but now I can see that they are well composed as well as tell a story by the choice of locations as well as depicting different people. My photography carries on my early memories of community, family and a sense of place, although I have chosen to look at a much larger extended family and community. Since I'm of Hispanic and Native American heritage, my work is very influenced and reflects these backgrounds while at the same time make a universal statement. As a multi discipline artist I work in different media such as drawing, painting, stained glass, ceramics, and mixed media, but with a main emphasis on photography as art. While in Japan, during the mid 1960's, I was very influenced by the cultural and environmental beauty of that country and I began a serious study of photography to document my experiences while there. This fascination with cultural, social and political documentation has continued to this day with my personal and artist photography reflecting my sense of community. In the late 1960's I enrolled in college with a dual major of Sociology and Fine Art. In the more than 30 years that I have been producing art images, there are cycles of recurring themes and a metamorphism of images and ideas. Some pieces are stand-alone images, while in others I combined photos into juxtaposed or organically combined collages. While some of my photos are also photo journalistic others are painterly. I work in traditional dark room printing as well as digitally created and manipulated and printed photography."         },		       {            "title" : "Changing Times: Los Angeles in Photographs",            "href" : "http://unitproj.library.ucla.edu/dlib/lat/",            "browseBy" : [                {                    "BrowseHref": "http://unitproj.library.ucla.edu/dlib/lat/subject.cfm",                    "BrowseSubj" : "Subject"                 }            ],			"dataType" : [				{"category" : "images"}							],             "description" : "The UCLA Charles E.

The family produced three popes, about thirty cardinals and 62 senators of Rome, as well as several electors of Saxony and Brandenburg, and grand masters of the Knights of Malta. They were related to a number of royal houses of Europe. The papers consist mainly of material relating to the administration of property (including records of sales, leases, mortgages, loans, proxies, accounting, inventories and plans) and the administration of the family (including dowries and marriage contracts, donations, divisions of property, wills and fideicommissums).

Harvested metadata about sheet music in participating collections is hosted by UCLA Digital Library Program, which provides an access service via this metadata to sheet music records at the host libraries. Data providers have chosen to catalog their sheet music in different ways, but a large proportion of the original sheets in participating collections has been digitized, allowing users direct access to the music itself and in many cases covers and advertisements that offer evidence of the cultural context in which the songs were published."         },		        {            "title" : "Society for Psychophysiological Research (Collection 1194)",            "href" : "/viewItem.do;jsessionid=E968ACEF677C3949199691755951EE5C.node1?ark=21198/zz001nf7r5",            "browseBy" : [                {                    "BrowseHref": "/browseContents.do;jsessionid=E968ACEF677C3949199691755951EE5C.node1?coreDescTermId=12&amp;selectedProjects=234",                    "BrowseSubj" : "Language"                 },                {                    "BrowseHref": "/browseContents.do;jsessionid=E968ACEF677C3949199691755951EE5C.node1?coreDescTermId=5&amp;selectedProjects=234",                    "BrowseSubj" : "Name"                 },                {                    "BrowseHref": "/browseContents.do;jsessionid=E968ACEF677C3949199691755951EE5C.node1?coreDescTermId=4&amp;selectedProjects=234",                    "BrowseSubj" : "Subject"                 },                {                    "BrowseHref": "/browseContents.do;jsessionid=E968ACEF677C3949199691755951EE5C.node1?coreDescTermId=9&amp;selectedProjects=234",                    "BrowseSubj" : "Type"                 }             ],			"dataType" : [				{"category" : "science"},				{"category" : "manuscripts"}					],            "description" : "The Society for Psychophysiological Research was created to foster research related to physiology and psychology.

      "description":"Kango Takamura (1895-1994) was an photo retoucher for RKO Studios in Los Angeles when Pearl Harbor was attacked by the Japanese Imperial Navy. He was detained by the FBI in 1942 after offering to sell a motion-picture camera to a visiting Japanese general. He was interned at Santa Fe, New Mexico for several months and then moved to a camp at Manzanar, California, where he joined his wife, daughter, son-in-law and granddaughter. He remained at Manzanar with his family until 1945. While at Manzanar, Takamura depicted his surroundings in drawings and watercolors. He also worked as a camp sign-maker at Santa Fe and as curator for a small museum at Manzanar. After the war, he returned to Hollywood and worked at RKO Studios for another twenty-five years before retiring. The collection consists of 77 watercolor paintings produced during World War II while Kango Takamura was detained at the Santa Fe Internment Camp, New Mexico, and the Manzanar Internment Camp, California. Also included are paper mounts and one photographic reproduction of a painting."
